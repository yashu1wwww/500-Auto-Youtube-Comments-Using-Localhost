or after chrome opens using localhost 

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

in my case chrome location(use start in:) is

click window button and search cmd and enter 

cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application (1st line in cmd)

in line enter 

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=""(in "enter your localhost path here") 

Next, enter this command into the terminal, replacing "enter your localhost path here" with your localhost path:

For example, in my case it is:

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost" (2nd line in cmd make sure you replace the localhost path)

# then again open new terminal in that folder enter h.py or double click on h.py

## To do 500+ auto comments, you must log in with 10+ accounts

# after login with 10 accs add these extension
https://shorturl.at/mtAER

In lines 12 of the code, change the comments if you want to use something different.

In line 21, change the movie video URL to the required URL.

in line 22 - no of comments per acc

in line 23 - no of accounts select to do auto comments

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and 500+ auto comments will be done automatically. 

in cmd enter

pip install Random
