or after chrome opens using localhost 

## C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

click window button and search cmd and enter 

cd

## C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application (1st line in cmd)

in line enter 

## chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=""(in "enter your localhost path here") 

Next, enter this command into the terminal, replacing "enter your localhost path here" with your localhost path:

For example, in my case it is:

## chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost" (2nd line in cmd make sure you replace the localhost path)

# then again open new terminal in that folder enter

pip install selenium==4.2.0

## To do 500+ auto comments, you must log in with 10+ accounts

## Each account must have 10 or more brand accounts to perform auto-comments. Replace the URL in the file with a YouTube video URL and run video.py for regular videos or shorts.py for YouTube Shorts.

# after login with 10 accs add these extension
https://shorturl.at/mtAER

In lines 11 of the code, change the comments if you want to use something different.

In line 21, change the movie video URL to the required URL.

press control + f and enter 50 and replace with how much cmts needed for each acc..

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and 500+ auto comments will be done automatically.
